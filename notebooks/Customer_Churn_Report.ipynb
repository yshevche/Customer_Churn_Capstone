    "As a business owner it is much easier to keep existing customers, then it is to find new ones. Focusing on keeping these relationships requires keeping a low customer churn rate. In this dataset customer churn is a marketing metric that describes the number of customers that leave a business over a specific period of time. Each user is assigned a prediction value that estimates their state of churn based on user demographic information, browsing behavior, and historical purchase data among other features. "

    "The data we are working with is mostly categorical so classification models where the best options. The harmonic mean  for the likelyhood of a customer leaving was accurately predicted at a higher rate by both weighted random forest classifier (RFC) and decision tree (DTC). Below are features of interest from the two models, all though they do hold some interest they only give us a guess about what the models used for predicting the outcome. A more reliable source are the classification reports where we can see precision and recall. The precision score or the rate at prediction for the true positive of the exiting customers were about 92% for both. While the individuals most likely to stay were around 94% predicted by random forest classifier and 90% for decision tree classifier. The recall score measures how many positive cases the classifier predicted. For predicting that a customer stayed RFC & DTC were around 91%. For the prediction of a customers risk of churn RFC did a better job at around 95% and DTC was the same at around 91%. "

    "Some business related recommendations for the marketing team to solve the problem of customer attrition. The best course of action is to try and keep customers rather then attract new ones. Similar to a leaking bucket, you can't fill a bucket with water if there's a hole at the bottom. Based on the performed analysis an area of interest may be advertising based on customer location. Most customers lived in towns with a close second being individuals living in cities. Membership status is also important with a majority of individuals at risk of churning either had no membership or basic membership status. A key factor was complaint status in the prediction of the model performance, with a majority of customers who had unsolved complaints. I recommend the team address how responsive they are to customer needs."
